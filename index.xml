Covered in this post are general trends on the amount of recipes published, who’s publishing the reicpes and what patterns exist in the communtiy. It was discovered that while the rate of new authorship and the activity of frequent authors has declined since 2014, the amount published per author has increased to keep the total number of new recipes added stable.</description>
